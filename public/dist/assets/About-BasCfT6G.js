As child. filled with hike with friends across the prairies and beyond helped to instill the confidence I have in the outdoors, and the deep appreciation that I hold for our natural world and its preservation. Despite photography having been a big part of my life for many years, I followed a different path after high school and chose a 'safe' career as a physiotherapist in italy.And although physiotherapy has been very rewarding to me, but my true passion lies in photographing the beauty of nature. The joy and freedom I feel in the outdoors gives me happiness, and my heart tells me that creating art is what I was meant to do. Landscape photography has enriched my life in countless ways; my self-taught exploration with the camera has gave me the circle of joy magically combining my love of nature and the creation of art the god gave to us in this world. It is very liberating to capture a fleeting moment in time that can be preserved forever as a beautiful fine art photography print. There's nothing like witnessing a burning sunrise or gazing up at the stars with fresh air in your lungs to help de-stress and reconnect with this amazing planet that we call home. At some time in life you have crossroads that are presented to you or thrust upon you.
